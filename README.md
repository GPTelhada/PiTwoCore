# PiTwoCore
This Arduino sketch demonstrates a dual-core approach to calculating Pi using the ESP32-S3 microcontroller. The sketch splits the calculation between the two cores of the ESP32-S3, improving execution time. The Leibniz series is used for the Pi approximation, with each core handling a portion of the calculation.
